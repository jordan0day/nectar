# Nectar

> An HTTP server for Elixir.

Nectar is a simple HTTP server implemented in Elixir. It is intended to be a replacement for [Cowboy](https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) 20.2.3 or later
* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) 1.6.1 or later

### Installation

The easiest way to add Nectar to your project is by [using Mix](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html).

Add `:nectar` as a dependency to `mix.exs`:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:nectar, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Then run:

```shell
$ mix deps.get
```

### Running

```shell
$ mix nectar.server
```
